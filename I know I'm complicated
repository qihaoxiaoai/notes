I know I'm complicated
And I'm sorry for all that
All the love I try to make
Comes out half baked or just falls flat
I'm a little bit a mess
But a lot of love at heart
Sometimes I just can't stop
Sometimes I just can't start
Well I never had a map
I never had a plan
All I have is scraps 
who and why and what I am
And I am a little less
And you are a little more
And I've never really seen my life in quite this light before
But If you ever call me now I will be here
And if you ever want me now I will be here
And if you ever need me now I will be here
I know what you need
And all you need from me is for me to be here
In a quieter safer place
When everyone you love is gone
sometimes it's easier that way
But If I had one more hour
if I had one more minute
the only thing I know is I would surely want you in it
And I watch the people walk
And I watch the people laugh
Every day I take a million perfect living photographs
And the days are getting shorter
And the years are flying by
And my favorite photographs 
are the ones of you and I
So if you ever want me now I will be here
And if you ever need me now I will be here
And if you wanna love me now I will be here
And I know what you need
And all you need from me 
Is for me to be here.
（And I am here）
